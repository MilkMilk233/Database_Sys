# Overview
This repository stores all my notes when learning DB system domain knowledge, including CSC3170 2022 Spring and other materials.
It is **not recommend** to take this course as the only way you learn about DB system. When I was learning, I refer a lot of other relevant materials, including but not limited to Github, blogs, Stack Overflow, Google, etc.
